You do not need to add ScalaTest to your build explicitly. 
The proper version of ScalaTest will be brought in automatically as a transitive dependency of ScalaTest + Play. 
You will, however, need to select a version of ScalaTest + Play that matches your Play version. 
You can do so by checking the releases compatibility matrix for ScalaTest + Play.
